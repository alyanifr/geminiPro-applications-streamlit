<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project leverages the LLM model from Google Gemini, to build applications that allows users to choose between a chatbot, a translator and an image caption generator. The UI used in this project is created using Streamlit to ensure a straightforward user experience. 
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<h3>‚öíÔ∏è Natural Language Processing</h3>
<ul>
 <li> Utilizes Google's Gemini-Pro large language model to interpret natural language queries. </li>
 <li> Generate response based on user's input. </li>
</ul>
<h3>‚öíÔ∏è Friendly User Interface</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Utilizes Streamlit interface to build the web application.</li>
  <li>A sidebar that allow user to choose between different application.</li>
  <li> Allow users to choose their choice of input and output languages. Consisting of a translate button to generate the desired output.</li>
  <li> Allow user to upload image of their choice as an input and get a response in which the model gives a brief description of the image.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Workflow</h2>
<h3>‚öíÔ∏è Google's Gemini Secret Key</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Generate the API key that was used to call on the llm model.</li>
  <li> Storing the secret key in a config.json file for a more efficient program architecture.</li>
</ul>
<h3>‚öíÔ∏è Modular Architectural Design</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Adopted a modular design by segregating functionalities into separate modules.</li>
  <li> Requirement file for installing all the required libraries, Gemini-Pro utilities for LLM model functionalities, main script where all of the Streamlit app page is configured.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Throughout this project, I managed to demonstrate the deployment of an easy and smooth multi application within a Streamlit page while also showcasing the integration of Google Gemini's llm model, and its language processing capabilities.
